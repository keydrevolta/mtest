# mtest

> A code that cannot be tested is flawed â€“ Anonymous

Mtest will cater to various testing needs of openebs projects. Mtest can be 
easily guided to try out a particular customer use case. On a simpler scheme

## mtest objectives

An operator should be able to create or update a test case with ease. She
should be able to infer the results of above executed test case as well. 

Operator need not write logic / programs to do so. Operator might use some scripting 
or binary commands to achieve her objective.
